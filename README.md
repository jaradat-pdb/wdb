Code developed and written while completing [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/):
> The only course you need to learn web development - HTML, CSS, JS, Node, and More!
Also included are resource bundles of frameworks and other libraries used throughout the course (for example: a Bootstrap 4 bundle containing v4.1.3 of the Bootstrap framework along with the required jQuery and PopperJS dependencies) to reduce the dependency of a decent internet connection to connect to CDN distribution networks.
