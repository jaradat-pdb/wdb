Code developed and written while completing [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/):

> The only course you need to learn web development - HTML, CSS, JS, Node, and More!
> Throughout the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:
> * __HTML5__
> * __CSS3__
> * __JavaScript__
> * __Bootstrap 4__
> * SemanticUI
> * DOM Manipulation
> * __jQuery__
> * Unix(Command Line) Commands
> * __NodeJS__
> * NPM
> * __ExpressJS__
> * REST
> * __MongoDB__
> * Database Associations
> * __Authentication__
> * PassportJS
> * Authorization

Also included are resource bundles of frameworks and other libraries used throughout the course (for example: a Bootstrap 4 bundle containing v4.1.3 of the Bootstrap framework along with the required jQuery and PopperJS dependencies) to reduce the dependency of a decent internet connection to connect to CDN distribution networks.
